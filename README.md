# x-men-web-selector-project
## A basic HTML-CSS-JavaScript web page developed during @devemdobro's SZPC workshop by july 2023.

In this simple but nice project we developed a complete webpage from scratch, following a Figma design. 
Besides providing a good revision in HTML, CSS and Javascript topics, the project can be viewed in different platforms (desktop and mobile). 

Thanks to Ricardo and Roberto,  instructors from the @devemdobro's Semana do Zero ao Programador Contratado Workshop.
